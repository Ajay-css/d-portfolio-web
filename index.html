            <h2>HTML</h2>
            <p>HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard language used to create and structure content on the
                web. It provides the foundation for building web pages by defining how text, images, links, and other
                multimedia elements are displayed in a browser. Essentially, it's the skeleton that gives a webpage its
                structure.</p>

            <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document
                written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes how elements
                should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.</p>

            <p>JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control
                multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. (Okay, not everything, but it is amazing

            <p>React.js, often referred to simply as React, is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces,
                particularly single-page applications (SPAs). Developed by Facebook, it focuses on creating interactive
                and dynamic UIs efficiently by utilizing a component-based architecture and a virtual DOM. React is
                known for its performance, flexibility, and ability to handle complex state management.

            <p>Node.js is a server-side runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It

                applications. Node.js is built on the V8 JavaScript engine, the same engine used in Google Chrome. It
